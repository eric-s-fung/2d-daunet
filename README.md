This is all the code needed to train and evaulate a 2D Data Augmented U-Net convolutional neural network for skull-stripping brain MR images.

Unfortunately, the TumPer dataset with unhealthy brain scans is not publicly available. 
However, the CC359 dataset is publicly available and can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/home
